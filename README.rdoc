== Welcome to my take on the Join Quipper test

As per instructions:

1. Use the latest stable Ruby - 1.9.3
2. Use the latest stable Rails - 3.2.3
3. Most of the code should be test-covered - try 100%
4. Using any database - sqlite3 in development, mySQL in production
5. Using any testing framework - used rspec, capybara, faker, launchy, guard and factory_girl

All user stories were comppleted, including the optional ones, and the application deployed
to heroku.
